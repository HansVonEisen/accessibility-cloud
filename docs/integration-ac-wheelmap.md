## Integration Widget auf der Detail Seite (1 Woche) "Accessibility nearby"

- 2 day workshop

## AC-Places on the map (Front-End pure)

- Design missing for...
  - Filter
  - Search
- ​

## Embed AC-place into data-stream (without widget)

- Client has to distinguish between AC places and wheelmap
- Client has do things like attribution / back-links
- One single request to Wheelmap API
  - Requires a method for wheelmap backend to fetch and cache AC data
  - Require wheelmapAPI versioning
  - Wheelmap API needs to be extended to support additional AC meta format data
  - WebApp needs some refactoring to also support the new data-format (or new API)
  - updated API allows integration of AC data into iOS and Android Apps
- ​

## De-duplication at client side

- could be a part of the AC api
- could help with legal issues



## iOS/Android App shows AC places on the map



## De-duplication at AC

- Only works, with receiver is also data source
