// Returns the user that is authenticated for the given token string, or undefined if the token
// is not valid / not found. The user is given as Meteor.users() document.

// Valid tokens are:
// - Meteor login tokens from a running session
// - App tokens. Currently, with an app token, you can authenticate as the first developer
//   or manager user account that is associated with the app's organization. This later has to
//   be changed so each organization member has their own token, as authenticating as a user
//   could give you access to their private data. We assume organization members currently trust
//   each other. App tokens are stored in an Apps MongoDB collection document.
